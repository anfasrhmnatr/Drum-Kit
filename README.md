# Drum-Kit
Itâ€™s a fun, music-based website that allows users to play virtual drum sounds using their keyboard keys. The design shows a set of drum images, each mapped to a specific key (w, a, s, d, j, k, l). When a user presses one of these keys on their keyboard (or clicks on the drum images), a corresponding drum or cymbal sound is played.
